Project Setup & Core Infrastructure (Phase 1)
TODO: Define Core Project Structure
Set up version control (e.g., Git repository).
Choose a primary programming language (e.g., C++, Rust, Java/Kotlin for UI with native audio backend).
Select a build system (e.g., CMake, Gradle, Meson).
Establish coding conventions and style guides.
TODO: Basic Windowing and UI Framework
Implement a main application window.
Set up a basic menu bar (File, Edit, View, etc.).
Choose and integrate a UI toolkit (e.g., Qt, Dear ImGui, Jetpack Compose for Desktop if using Kotlin, custom solution).
TODO: Audio Engine Core
Implement low-level audio I/O (input/output) using platform-specific APIs (e.g., ASIO, CoreAudio, ALSA, AAudio for Android if relevant to "XS compat").
Create a basic audio processing graph/pipeline.
Implement sample rate and bit depth handling.
Basic mixing capabilities (summing audio streams).
TODO: Logging and Error Handling Framework
Implement a robust logging system for debugging.
Define a strategy for error handling and reporting. Core DAW Features (Phase 2)
TODO: Timeline and Arrangement View
Design and implement the main timeline for arranging audio/MIDI clips.
Implement zooming and scrolling.
Grid and snapping functionality.
Track headers (name, mute, solo, record arm).
TODO: Audio Track Functionality
Ability to add/remove audio tracks.
Audio clip import (WAV, MP3, OGG).
Basic audio clip manipulation (move, trim, fade in/out).
Volume and pan controls per track.
TODO: MIDI Track Functionality
Ability to add/remove MIDI tracks.
MIDI clip import/creation.
Piano roll editor for MIDI notes.
Velocity and duration editing.
TODO: Transport Controls
Play, Pause, Stop, Record buttons.
Looping functionality.
Tempo and time signature settings.
TODO: Mixer View
Dedicated mixer panel showing faders, pan, mute/solo for each track.
Master output channel.
TODO: Plugin Support (Initial)
Define a basic internal plugin architecture.
Investigate common plugin formats (VST, AU, LV2) if "XS compat" doesn't refer to a specific internal format.
Implement loading and processing for at least one simple internal effect (e.g., Gain, Delay). "XS Compat." Specifics (Phase 3 - Requires Clarification)
TODO: Investigate and Define "XS compat."
If Cross-Platform:
TODO: Ensure core audio engine is platform-agnostic or has platform-specific backends.
TODO: Test UI rendering on target platforms.
TODO: Set up CI/CD for multi-platform builds.
If Compatibility with "XS" Software/Standard:
TODO: Research the "XS" specification/API.
TODO: Implement necessary interfaces or data formats for "XS" interoperability.
TODO: Test compatibility with existing "XS" tools/files.
If "Extra Small" / Lite Version related:
TODO: Define feature set for the "XS" compatible version.
TODO: Implement build flags or modules to create different versions. Advanced Features & Polish (Phase 4+)
TODO: Recording Functionality
Audio input selection.
Recording to audio tracks.
MIDI input recording.
TODO: Advanced Editing Tools
Time stretching / Pitch shifting.
Automation (volume, pan, plugin parameters).
Beat detection.
TODO: More Built-in Instruments and Effects
Basic Synthesizer.
Sampler.
EQ, Compressor, Reverb.
TODO: Expanded Plugin Support
Support for popular third-party plugin formats (VST2, VST3, AU, LV2).
Plugin scanning and management.
TODO: Project Save/Load Functionality
Define a project file format.
Implement saving all project data (tracks, clips, settings, automation).
Implement loading projects.
TODO: Export/Bounce Functionality
Export project to audio files (WAV, MP3, OGG).
Stem export.
TODO: UI/UX Refinements
Improve visual design.
Optimize workflows.
Add customizable themes/layouts.
TODO: Performance Optimization
Optimize audio processing for low latency.
Efficient memory management.
Optimize UI responsiveness.
TODO: Documentation
User manual.
Developer documentation (for contributors).
TODO: Testing
Unit tests for core components.
Integration tests for feature interactions.
User acceptance testing.
TODO: Community Building (Open Source Aspect)
Set up contribution guidelines.
Create forums/communication channels.
Issue tracking. Recurring Tasks:
TODO: Regular code refactoring and cleanup.
TODO: Bug fixing.
TODO: Dependency updates.
TODO: Review and merge community contributions (if any). This is a comprehensive but not exhaustive list. The order and priority would depend on the project's specific goals and the meaning of "XS compat." For an open-source project, starting with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on core functionality is often a good strategy.
